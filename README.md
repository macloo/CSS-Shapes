# CSS Shapes

These are my own solutions from [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). All CSS &mdash; no SVG and no images. For more shapes, see [The Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/). Some shapes here use `position: absolute` and others use only `margin`.

I have a habit of not using `::before` and `::after`.

I learned *so much* about [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius).

**Note:** No need for the `z-index` property. The order determines overlap.
